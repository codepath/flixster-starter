### Reflection
* Did the topics discussed in your labs prepare you to complete the assignment? Be specific, which features in your weekly assignment did you feel unprepared to complete?

The topics discussed in my labs did prepare me to complete the assignment, but it only prepared me with useState and useEffect. I wish the labs went over passing variables to sibling components.

* If you had more time, what would you have done differently? Would you have added additional features? Changed the way your project responded to a particular event, etc.

I think I would not have change my code differently since my project runs well and completes the core features and almost all of the stretch features. I configured it so anything to modify the movie cards would reuse the same useEffect property. 
  
* Reflect on your project demo, what went well? Were there things that maybe didn't go as planned? Did you notice something that your peer did that you would like to try next time?

I believe what went well was showing the movie cards and adding a footer and header. What did not go as planned was setting up the modal since I originally thought it would be the same process as the week 1 project, but I had to learn about passing variables between sibling components to fix the issue.

### Shout out

I would like to give a shout out to George for helping me debug my code and taught me how I can improve my skills on fixing my errors. I also would like to shout out Theo for helping me fix my like button stretch feature error I had when I imported my project into render.
