### Reflection

* Did the topics discussed in your labs prepare you to complete the assignment? Be specific, which features in your weekly assignment did you feel unprepared to complete?

The topics discussed in the labs provided a good foundation for completing the assignment, particularly in managing state with hooks, integrating APIs, and structuring the application with reusable components. However, there were areas where I felt less prepared. Designing responsive and visually appealing components like the modal and sidebar was challenging due to limited coverage of advanced CSS and styling techniques. Managing state across multiple components, especially for dynamic updates to the favorites and watched lists, was more complex than expected. Although basic event handling was covered, implementing features like toggling favorites and marking movies as watched required more advanced knowledge. Error handling with API requests and integrating external libraries like FontAwesome for icons were also areas where additional guidance would have been helpful. Overall, while the labs were beneficial, more focus on these advanced topics would have better prepared me for the assignment.

* If you had more time, what would you have done differently? Would you have added additional features? Changed the way your project responded to a particular event, etc.
  
If I had more time, I would have made several improvements and added additional features to enhance the project. Firstly, I would refine the user interface to ensure a more cohesive and visually appealing design, paying particular attention to responsiveness across different devices. This includes optimizing the layout of the modal and sidebar components and ensuring smooth animations for opening and closing these elements.

Additionally, I would implement more robust error handling for API requests, providing clear feedback to users in case of network issues or data retrieval errors. Enhancing the state management logic to handle complex interactions more efficiently would also be a priority, ensuring a seamless user experience when toggling favorites and marking movies as watched.

I would consider adding features such as user authentication to personalize the experience and allow users to save their favorite movies and watched lists across sessions. Another feature could be a recommendation system based on the user's viewing history and preferences.

Finally, I would refine the event-handling mechanisms to make interactions more intuitive and responsive, ensuring that the project responds smoothly to user actions such as sorting, searching, and interacting with movie cards. These enhancements would significantly improve the overall functionality and user experience of the project.

* Reflect on your project demo, what went well? Were there things that maybe didn't go as planned? Did you notice something that your peer did that you would like to try next time?

Reflecting on my project demo, I was particularly pleased with the implementation of the modal, which provided a detailed and engaging way to display movie information and trailers. The modal design and functionality turned out to be intuitive and visually appealing, enhancing the overall user experience.

However, I did encounter challenges while implementing the sidebar. Ensuring it updated correctly with favorite and watched movies, as well as making it responsive and user-friendly, proved to be more complex than anticipated. This was an area where things didn't go entirely as planned, and it highlighted the need for better state management and event handling in my project.

During the demo, I noticed a peer who had seamlessly integrated a more advanced sorting and filtering system, which greatly enhanced the usability of their project. This is something I would like to try in my next project, as it would provide users with a more dynamic and interactive experience. Their approach to sorting and filtering was efficient and user-friendly, and incorporating a similar feature would be a valuable addition to my own projects in the future.
