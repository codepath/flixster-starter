### Reflection

* Did the topics discussed in your labs prepare you to complete the assignment? Be specific, which features in your weekly assignment did you feel unprepared to complete?

I felt unprepared handling the useState and useEffects, passing props from Parent to Child and Child back to Parents was also difficult for me. I also felt unprepared to access the data from the API calls at first, but after doing it multiple times I was able to get the hang of it. 

* If you had more time, what would you have done differently? Would you have added additional features? Changed the way your project responded to a particular event, etc.
  
If I had more time I would have done more CSS designs and made my app a little more responsive. I would have also styled my side bar a lot better. 

* Reflect on your project demo, what went well? Were there things that maybe didn't go as planned? Did you notice something that your peer did that you would like to try next time?

I think my demo went well, My peers did a lot of cool designs and animations and I would like to try some more of that next time.
