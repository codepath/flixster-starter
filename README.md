### Reflection

* Did the topics discussed in your labs prepare you to complete the assignment? Be specific, which features in your weekly assignment did you feel unprepared to complete?

Yes the labs did prepare me

* If you had more time, what would you have done differently? Would you have added additional features? Changed the way your project responded to a particular event, etc.
  
I would have added users be able to click on the movies in the favorite tab and the modal for the movie dsplays.

* Reflect on your project demo, what went well? Were there things that maybe didn't go as planned? Did you notice something that your peer did that you would like to try next time?

I think being able to do most of the stretch feautres was the best thing. One thing that did not go as planned was having to move code around because i didnt understand passing props properling and how states should be higher up in componenets that need it.
