### Reflection

* Did the topics discussed in your labs prepare you to complete the assignment? Be specific, which features in your weekly assignment did you feel unprepared to complete?
The labs helped me as well as the code demos done in class. that really helped me understand why I could get any errors and how I could resolve them. it also ensured that I was able to get the foundational knowledge I needed to grasp React

* If you had more time, what would you have done differently? Would you have added additional features? Changed the way your project responded to a particular event, etc.
If I had more time, I would implement more CSS features and add some animations. I would also want a button that if clicked on would take you back to the top as scrolling is tedious. Also, i would want my search bar to immediately start displaying movies as soon as the user starts to type on the search bar.

* Reflect on your project demo, what went well? Were there things that maybe didn't go as planned? Did you notice something that your peer did that you would like to try next time?
I like how my modal turned out and how I was able to also add the embedded video trailer. I nticed that one of my peers used an image from the movies as the header and it displayed some of the information on it. I would like to try it next time.
