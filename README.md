# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

üìù `NOTE` Use this template to initialize the contents of a README.md file for your application. As you work on your assignment over the course of the week, update the required or stretch features lists to indicate which features you have completed by changing `[ ]` to `[x]`. (üö´ Remove this paragraph before submitting your assignment.)

### Reflection

* Did the topics discussed in your labs prepare you to complete the assignment? Be specific, which features in your weekly assignment did you feel unprepared to complete?

They prepared me for only a little part the project. Lectures on useState and API calls did help

* If you had more time, what would you have done differently? Would you have added additional features? Changed the way your project responded to a particular event, etc.

With more time, I would have done some more unique designs for User experience

* Reflect on your project demo, what went well? Were there things that maybe didn't go as planned? Did you notice something that your peer did that you would like to try next time?

Using APIs for the first time stood out to me. I always thought it was a really hard and long process

### Open-source libraries used

### Shout out

Give a shout out to somebody from your cohort that especially helped you during your project. This can be a fellow peer, instructor, TA, mentor, etc.
I would like to shout out to my manager for taking her time to break down concepts for my understanding. Also special appreciation to Paige, Sammy, and Erika for the quick fixes and debugging help. And to my peers like Izu, Dara, Ian, shoutout for brainstorming solutions with me.
